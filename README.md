# Pathfinding in a Labyrinth

This repository contains a Go implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in a labyrinth represented by a grid of cells. Each cell has a cost associated with entering it, and the goal is to find the path from a starting cell to a finishing cell with the minimum total cost.
